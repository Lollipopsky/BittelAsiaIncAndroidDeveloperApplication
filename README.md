# WeatherApp

## Overview

The **WeatherApp** is a comprehensive weather forecast application designed to provide users with up-to-date weather information. This application employs both the **Model-View-Intent (MVI)** and **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** architectural patterns to ensure a clean separation of concerns and maintainability.

## Features

- Real-time weather updates
- User-friendly interface
- Location-based weather information

## Architecture

### WeatherForecastApp

The **WeatherForcastApp** module utilizes **Jetpack Compose** for building modern user interfaces in a declarative manner. Additionally, it implements the **Clean Architecture** pattern, which promotes a well-structured codebase, making it easier to manage and test.

### Key Technologies

- **Jetpack Compose**: For building UI components.
- **MVI and MVVM**: For managing application state and UI interactions.
- **Clean Architecture**: For structuring the application into distinct layers.
